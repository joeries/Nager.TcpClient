# Nager.TcpClient

A simple **TcpClient** with asynchronous connect logic. Received data packets are available via a `DataReceived` event. There are also events for `Connected` and `Disconnected`. Additionally there is the possibility to enable `TcpKeepAlive`. The library offers the possibility to pass an `ILogger` for logging. There are extensive tests for all major operating systems (ubuntu, windows, macos).

## Examples of use

For the examples, an online service `tcpbin.com` is used that returns all sent packages. 

### Simple example send and receive data

```cs
void OnDataReceived(byte[] receivedData)
{
}

using var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource(1000);

using var tcpClient = new TcpClient();
tcpClient.DataReceived += OnDataReceived;
await tcpClient.ConnectAsync("tcpbin.com", 4242, cancellationTokenSource.Token);
await tcpClient.SendAsync(new byte[] { 0x01, 0x0A });
await Task.Delay(400);
tcpClient.Disconnect();
tcpClient.DataReceived -= OnDataReceived;
```
